DataQuest Guided Project - Exploring HackerNews Posts
In this project, I work with a data set of submissions to popular technology site Hacker News.
I'm specifically interested in posts whose titles begin with either Ask HN or Show HN. Users submit Ask HN posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question.
I'll compare these two types of posts to determine the following:

Do Ask HN or Show HN receive more comments on average?
Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?
